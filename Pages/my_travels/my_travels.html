		<h3>San Pedro de Atacama</h3>
		<p class="content">I was statined in San Pedro de Atacama for one year as the senior research technician for the <a href="../my_work/my_work.html#CLASS" class="para_link">Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor</a>. My tenure in the driest non-polar desert in the world began in June 2016, right after I graduated from Johns Hopkins University. I lived in hotel Casa Don Esteban and for work I traveled up to Cerro Toco, a mountain in the Andes where many cosmology telescopes are located. I spent my free time exploring the area in a 4X4 truck and taking part in local festivites such as Carnival and Chilean Independence Day! I'm currently working on an insider's guide to San Pedro de Atacama! In progress <a href="../SanPedro/Pages/Home/En/index.html" class="para_link">here</a>. Other adventures included a beach trip to Iquique, multiple excursions to Santiago, and a hiking vacation in Argentinian Patagonia!

		<h3>Geneva</h3>
		<p class="content">I lived in Geneva in 2015. While there I took classes at the University of Geneva and worked at CERN. Under Giovanni Cantatore, I worked on the <a href="../my_work/my_work.html#KWISP" class="para_link"></a> project. Given Geneva's central location in Europe I was able to visit other countries such as France, Holland, Italy, and Spain. One of the highlights was sailing down the coast of Italy to explore Cinque Terre. Every night we stopped at one of the shore side towns to eat, drink, and rest our tired sea legs.</p>

		<h3>Baltimore</h3>
		<p class="content">I attended Johns Hopkins University starting in 2012. I graduated in 2016 with a masters in physics and a bachelor's of science in both physics and math. For the first two years, I lived in on-campus housing. As a Freshman I lived in AMR I and as a sophemore I lived in McCoy also known as McCozy or McCool. For my last two years at Johns Hopkins University, I inhereted the house at 102 east 32nd street, also known as "Red Pillars". We loved to throw social events such as parties and dinners, and event attendees could always find our house as the only one with painted red columns.</p>

		<h3>Beijing</h3>
		<p class="content">In 2012 I had the oppotunity to study Mandarin Chinese at Tsinghua University in Beijing. In addition to seeing some classic Beijing tourist attractions such as the Forbidden City, the Great Wall, and the Summer Palace, I visited Shanghai, Hong Kong, and the Jiuzhaigou national park in Sichuan province. Before returning back to the United States, I took a trip to South East Asia where I visited Bangkok, Thailand, and then saw the temples and island hopped around Cambodia.</p>

		<h3>Annecy</h3>
		<p class="content">Before going to Beijing, I lived in a homestay in Annecy, France. Annecy is considered the Venice of France since there are canals and streams winding their way through the city. In France, I was able to indulge in my passion for skiing and carved up the slopes at La Clusaz, La Toussuire, Les Arcs, Les Gets, Meribel, Saint Francois/Valmorel, and Val D'arly. Skiing in Europe is liberating as there are no rules. Skiing off-piste in avalanche country, while not encouraged, is easily accessible to anyone daring and prepared enough to ski it. Living in Annecy also helped me improve my French to a conversational level.</p>

		<h3>Nepal</h3>
		<p class="content">In 2011 I stayed in a monastery in a small village an hour from Kathmandu. While there, I taught English to the monks, in exchange I was invited to join their Buddhist ceremonies and I spent my free time trying to learn as much Buddhism as I could. I befriended locals who lived outside the monastery, who I taught English to as well. In our free time we would play chess and explore the surrounding area. One week, I was invited to their hometown in the mountains where for the first time in my life I was shown first-hand the farmer's lifestyle.</p>
