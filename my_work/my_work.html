<h4>CLASS: Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor</h4>

<div class="content" id="CLASS_content">
	<p>
		The most widely accepted understanding of the evolution of the universe is explained by the ΛCDM (lambda cold dark matter) cosmological model which includes both dark energy (lambda) and cold dark matter (CDM). However, this model fails to explain a few things that are observed in today's universe: namely the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Magnetic_monopoles">magnetic monopole problem</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem">flatness problem</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_problem">horizon problem</a>. In 1981, Alan Guth resolved these problems by introducing a period of rapid expansion to the ΛCDM model he coined inflation; however, there has never been experimental proof that inflation occurred. CLASS is a telescope designed to study the Cosmic Microwave Background for signs of inflation. Led by Tobias Marriage, and Charles Bennett (The principle investigator of the WMAP satellite) who are both professors at Johns Hopkins University, CLASS has the state-of-the-art sensitivity needed to explore this cosmic mystery. You can read more about it <a href="http://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/class/">here</a>!

		I began working on CLASS in the summer of 2013 as an undergraduate at Johns Hopkins University. During my first year with CLASS, I worked with a Fourier Transform Spectrometer to study the optical properties of various materials that could be used as a lens for the telescope. The next year, I wrote a program to determine the thermal coupling constant between the Transition Edge Sensor detectors (which operate at 70 millikelvin) and the thermal bath they are connected to. I started working with the cryostats (cryogenic systems that house our detectors) during my third year. I prepared the cryostats for deployment in the field, and my work continued into my fourth year with the project. My work culminated in a senior thesis that you can read <a href="CLASS_thesis.pdf">here</a>.

	<p>
		After finishing my undergraduate studies at Johns Hopkins University, I moved to San Pedro de Atacama to work as the Senior Research Technician for the telescope. Six days a week, I drive up to the telescope, which is situated at 5200 meters (17,000 feet) on Cerro Toco, a mountain in the Andes. My main responsibility is to ensure that the telescope runs as smoothly as possible. The tasks I have to perform change daily and range from designing and installing additions that reduce vibrations, ground pickup, and other noise inducing sources, to installing new injectors for our diesel generators.

<h4>KWISP (Kinetic WISP Detection)</h4>

		In the Spring of 2015, I studied abroad in Geneva, Switzerland. While there, I worked with Professor Giovanni Cantatore at The European Organization for Nuclear Research or CERN (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire). CERN is home to the Large Hadron Collider, the world's largest and most powerful particle collider. However, while at CERN, I opted to work on KWISP (Kinetic WISP detection), a project with astrophysical relevance. KWISP is a detector mounted on the back of the CAST telescope, which is essentially an excess Large Hadron Collider magnet that can submit particles to large magnetic fields.

		Another great mystery in physics today is the content of dark energy. In 1998, the first direct evidence of dark energy was detected when physicists realized that the expansion of the universe is accelerating, which was revolutionary considering they believed the expansion would be decelerating due to gravity. While we see evidence of dark energy, we do not know what it is made up of. One candidate for dark energy is the chameleon particle, a particle with unique properties that change with the surrounding mass density. In places with less density, the expansive power of this particle (and its corresponding field) increases, explaining the accelerating expansion of the universe since as the universe expands, it becomes less dense, increasing the power of the chameleon field. 
	</p>
	<p>
		In order to detect these particles, KWISP plans to send chameleon particles through a thin film, from which chameleon particles would rebound off of because of the steep gradient in mass density (from vacuum to film). The film will then be placed in a Fabrey-Perot cavity with the sensitivity to detect a slight displacement in the film. Given the sensitivity of the cavity, the optical setup has to be very precise. During my time at CERN, I determined the beam waist of a laser and my final paper can be read <a href="KWISP_paper.pdf">here</a>.

		I interned at <a href="http://www.jhuapl.edu/">APL</a> in the Summer of 2014. APL is a JHU affiliated lab that undertakes projects related to national security (missile defense, sea control, cyber operations, etc.) and civil space missions (NASA's <a href="http://pluto.jhuapl.edu/index.php">New Horizon</a> mission to Pluto was operated from APL).

		Under Jennifer Cooper and Pat Ferat of the KTY acoustics group, I worked on a project to determine the amount of interference an underwater sound detector may hear from sperm whale vocalizations (sonar). First I used 3MB (Marine Mammal Movement and Behavior) software to simulate sperm whale movements in a patch of ocean. This data was then transfered to Matlab and combined with CASS, a ray-tracing software, to determine when and where a sperm whale may interfere with an underwater hydrophone. My work was written up for APL distribution and you can read it <a href="APL_memo.pdf">here</a>.
