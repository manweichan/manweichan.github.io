<h2>Salar de Tara</h2>

<div id="intro container">

<div class="content" id="facts">
	<ul style="list-style-type:none">
		<li><strong>Time</strong>: All day (8am-7pm). Example breakdown (Ultimate Ambitious Plan): 2.5 hours driving to the lake after Piedras Rojas. 1 hour at that lake. 2.5 hours at Piedras Rojas and lunch. 1 hour to Lagunas Antiplanicas. 2 hours at Lagunas Antiplanicas. 1 hour to Laguna Chaxa. 30 minutes at Laguna Chaxa. 30 minutes back to San Pedro. </li>
		<li><strong>Altitude</strong>: 4120 meters (13,520 feet)</li>
		<li><strong>Activity</strong>: Sightseeing (lakes, mountains, geological features, wildlife (vicuna and flamingoes)), wading (if you know the secret spots).</li>
		<li><strong>Price</strong>: $ No entrance fees except for Lagunas Antiplanicas (3,000 CLP or 2,500 CLP for students)! If skipping Lagunas Antiplanicas, there are no costs except for renting the car and gas. Otherwise a tour can get a bit pricey depending on what is included.</li>

<h4>Insider Tips</h4>
<div id="insider">
<ol id="insider_list" class="content">
	<li>At the end of the road at the Tres Marias, you can actually turn left and travel about 5-10 minutes by car to find an abandoned structure and a nice view of the salt flats. It is not as impressive as the other features in Valle de la Luna, and it is the furthest feature from the entrance. Because of this, it is empty most of the time, and it can be used as a nice repreive from the crowded areas of this popular park. If you have the time, this is definitely a place to check out and enjoy some solitary time.</li>
	<li>Everyone goes to watch the sunset at the great dune at the end of the day. Everyone crowds around the area closest to the great dune and the path that leads up to it. To get away from the crowds, you can walk along the ridge towards the west (towards the sunset) and get to some nice places where you can get some breathing room and get a unique view of the salt ridges that make up the Cordillera.</li>
	<li>You can use the ticket for Valle de la Luna for Coyote point as well. It is always packed with tourist vans who have previously taken their passengers through Valle de la Luna as well. From this point you will be overlooking the Valle which offers a cool opportunity to view the interesting shadows created by the salt ridges during sunset. For a view that doesn't require you to use your Valle de la Luna entrance ticket, there is a "mirador" before Coyote point that a lot of people stop at. This view gives you less of a view of the entire cordillera but more of a view of San Pedro de Atacama and the northern mountains. Lastly, to be cheap and solitary, you can just park your vehicle at one of the areas to pull off before the "mirador" and just climb one of the ridges themselves!</li>
	<li>I have heard that bikers to Coyote point, if you avoid the gatehouse you can get in for free, whether or not you went to Valle de la Luna beforehand. Just be ready for a nice uphill ride (but it is all downhill on the way down)! Also if biking, be sure you have reflective gear that makes you visible at night. There are no street lights so pay attention to the automobiles, especially when traveling back after the sunset.</li>

<h4>How To Get There</h4>

			There are two possible ways to get to Valle de la Luna from town. The first is to take 23 CH (the road to Calama) and make a left onto Paso Sico (the turn is marked by a sign pointing to Valle de la Luna). From there you just have to follow the signs until you hit a fork, at which you make a right to the entrance of Valle de la Luna. The other way is to take Paso Sico from the south side. Depending on where you are staying in San Pedro this route may be faster. This way will take you by Sequitor, one of the districts within San Pedro. To get to Coyote Point, get back on 23 CH and follow it away from San Pedro. You will pass <a href="#muerte">Valle de la Muerte</a> and then a passage with mini dirt ridges to your left. I've heard it called dinosaur alley because the ridges can seem simialr to stegosauruses. You will pass the parking areas where you can reach the free sunset ridge mentioned above, and then you will pass the official free "mirador". Shortly after you will arrive at Coyote Point.
