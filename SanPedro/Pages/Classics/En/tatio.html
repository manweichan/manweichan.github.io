	<h3>Summary</h3>
	<p id="summary_content">Spending a morning with the Tatio Geysers may make you believe you are on another planet. The geysers range from small bubbling pools to steam clouds that are as tall as 3 story buildings. After visiting the geysers, you can go swim in a thermal pool. On the way back to town you can stop at the small, charming village of Machuca where they sell llama kebabs and llama empanadas, and you can visit their little church on a hill. There are also some pretty lakes with flamingos along the road that you can stop by on the drive back to San Pedro. In order to see the Geysers you have to wake up around 1.5-2 hours before sunrise in order to arrive in Tatio when the geysers are most magnificent. The steam columns are largest and most visible when the air temperature is a lot colder than the thermal source of the geysers.</p>

<h4>Insider Tips</h4>
<div id="insider">
<ol id="insider_list" class="content">
	<li>Grab some croissants and baguettes the night before from La Frenchuteria and have them for breakfast the day you go to Tatio.</li>
	<li>Bring your warmest clothes as the mornings can be below freezing. Once the sun rises, the temperature will get warm enough to swim, so bring your sun screen as well!</li>
	<li>There are a few good places to take pictures of the sunrise on the way to Tatio in the morning. One of which are at the geysers themselves, but I actually prefer the sunset at the green dot on the map below. Sunrise at the geysers is pretty, as the sun will be rising over the Andes; however, you won't get the beautiful orange and reds of a sunrise that appear only when the sun is right at the horizon (since it will be blocked by the mountain). At the green dot on the map below, there is a wide plain, and even though the sun rises above the Andes as well, the mountains are a lot further away allowing you to catch the nice sunrise colors.</li>
	<li>In the thermal pool, the hot water enters the pool from one stream on the shallow side. This is the prime real estate where everyone gathers since it is the warmest area. The water is very hot! But a little flutter of your hand to mix the water with the rest of the pool water can quickly bring it to the perfect temperature.</li>
	<li>A nice lake to stop by on the way back to San Pedro is the one right after Machuca. On the left there will be a lake, hopefully filled with flamingoes and llamas. You can park anywhere along the road and then get out of your vehicle to look around!</li>

<h4>How To Get There</h4>

		<p>
			If you have access to google maps or the application maps.me, you can plug in the Tatio Geysers and follow the directions using your phone. For those without these resources, you want to take the road heading north that goes by the big parking lot, farmer's market, and the cemetary (B-245). From there just follow the signs directing you to Tatio. To know that you are on the right track, you should encounter a big dip in the road, then the small town of Guatin. At Guatin you make a left at the fork. The right path also can get you to Tatio but is longer and is the main road to the <a href="#Puritama">Termas Puritama</a>. You will then follow a mountainous road and pass Machuca (red dot on map) and other small towns, some of which I find funny because there is only one visible house (are they the sheriff, police, and judge of their town?). After the mountains you will drive across a desert plain (green dot on map) where you can take nice sunrise photos. Continue following until you reach the entrance of Tatio where you will have to pay your entrance fee and have the option to use the bathroom before continuing onto the geysers.
